# Release v1.6.0 - Strict Store Isolation & Identity

**Date**: December 26, 2025
**Version**: 1.6.0

## Critical Security & Privacy Fixes
*   **Strict Store Isolation**: Implemented enforcement logic in `ProductsController`, `SalesController`, `InventoryController`, and `TillsController`.
    *   Non-admin users are now legally bound to their assigned `storeId`.
    *   Requests without a valid `storeId` context are denied or filtered to return no data, preventing leakage of global stats.
*   **Inventory Partitioning**: Resolved issue where "All Products" view leaked global inventory counts. Inventory data is now filtered at the database level using `storeId`.

## UI/UX Enhancements
*   **Store Identity**: Dashboard now correctly identifies the active context.
    *   **Staff View**: Displays "Assigned Store Name" (e.g., Old coffee shop).
    *   **Admin View**: Displays "Selected Store" or "HQ Dashboard".
*   **Report Accuracy**: EOD Reports generated by staff now carry the correct Store Name header, ensuring audit trails match physical locations.
*   **Multi-Location Dashboard**: Admins can now reliably switch between "All Locations" and specific stores using the header dropdown.

## Backend Hardening
*   **RBAC Logic**: Fixed flawed `isAdmin` checks that prevented "Administrator" role from accessing multi-store tools.
*   **Fallback Prevention**: Removed dangerous "Default to All" logic in Sales API that triggered when store ID was missing.

## Known Issues
*   None. System behaves as expected for Multi-Store Retail environments.
